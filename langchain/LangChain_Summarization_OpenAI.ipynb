       "[\"What are large language models (LLMs)?\\nA large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new content. The term generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content.\\n\\nOver millennia, humans developed spoken languages to communicate. Language is at the core of all forms of human and technological communications; it provides the words, semantics and grammar needed to convey ideas and concepts. In the AI world, a language model serves a similar purpose, providing a basis to communicate and generate new concepts.\\n\\nThe first AI language models trace their roots to the earliest days of AI. The Eliza language model debuted in 1966 at MIT and is one of the earliest examples of an AI language model. All language models are first trained on a set of data, and then they make use of various techniques to infer relationships and then generate new content based on the trained data. Language models are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications where a user inputs a query in natural language to generate a result.\\n\\nAn LLM is the evolution of the language model concept in AI that dramatically expands the data used for training and inference. In turn, it provides a massive increase in the capabilities of the AI model. While there isn't a universally accepted figure for how large the data set for training needs to be, an LLM typically has at least one billion or more parameters. Parameters are a machine learning term for the variables present in the model on which it was trained that can be used to infer new content.Modern LLMs emerged in 2017 and use transformer models, which are neural networks commonly referred to as transformers. With a large number of parameters and the transformer model, LLMs are able to understand and generate accurate responses rapidly, which makes the AI technology broadly applicable across many different domains.\\n\\nSome LLMs are referred to as foundation models, a term coined by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence in 2021. A foundation model is so large and impactful that it serves as the foundation for further optimizations and specific use cases.Why are LLMs becoming important to businesses?\\nAs AI continues to grow, its place in the business setting becomes increasingly dominant. This is shown through the use of LLMs as well as machine learning tools. In the process of composing and applying machine learning models, research advises that simplicity and consistency should be among the main goals. Identifying the issues that must be solved is also essential, as is comprehending historical data and ensuring accuracy.\\n\\nThe benefits associated with machine learning are often grouped into four categories: efficiency, effectiveness, experience and business evolution. As these continue to emerge, businesses invest in this technology.\\n\\nHow do large language models work?\\nLLMs take a complex approach that involves multiple components.\\n\\nAt the foundational layer, an LLM needs to be trained on a large volume -- sometimes referred to as a corpus -- of data that is typically petabytes in size. The training can take multiple steps, usually starting with an unsupervised learning approach. In that approach, the model is trained on unstructured data and unlabeled data. The benefit of training on unlabeled data is that there is often vastly more data available. At this stage, the model begins to derive relationships between different words and concepts.\\n\\nThe next step for some LLMs is training and fine-tuning with a form of self-supervised learning.

       " 'Next, the LLM undertakes deep learning as it goes through the transformer neural network process. The transformer model architecture enables the LLM to understand and recognize the relationships and connections between words and concepts using a self-attention mechanism.
